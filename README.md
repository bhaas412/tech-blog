# Tech Blog

## Description

This project is a tech blog site that handles blog posts and comments on other developers' blog posts as well. The model-view-controller paradigm is used during this development with Handlebars.js. Data is stored in a MySQL database using MySQL2 and Sequelize is used as the object-relational mapping tool. An API for the controllers was created with Express.js.

The express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages handle user authentication.
